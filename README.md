Ultra AI Voice TTS

A professional web-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) application designed for high-fidelity audio synthesis. This system provides a streamlined interface for converting text into natural-sounding speech with granular control over vocal characteristics.
Project Overview

This application serves as a localized AI voice generation lab. It leverages a Python-based backend to process text input and output audio through a modern, responsive web interface. The architecture is optimized for low-latency conversion and ease of deployment.
Core Features

    Parameter Customization: Users can adjust speech rate (0.5 to 2.0) and output volume (0.0 to 1.0) for precise audio delivery.

    Voice Profiles: Integrated support for multiple voice identities, including male and female profiles.

    Dark-Mode Interface: A high-contrast, professional UI designed for extended use and visual clarity.

    Local Deployment: Fully functional on local server environments (default port 5000).
