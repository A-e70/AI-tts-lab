# Ultra AI Voice TTS: High-Fidelity Audio Synthesis Lab

This system provides a professional-grade web interface for converting text into natural-sounding speech with granular control over vocal characteristics. The architecture focuses on low-latency processing and a modern, high-contrast user experience for localized AI audio generation.

### Core Logic:
* **Synthesis Engine:** Processes raw text input into high-fidelity audio output via a Python-based backend.
* **Parameter Modulator:** Dynamically adjusts speech rate and volume based on precise user-defined variables.
* **Identity Switcher:** Toggles between optimized male and female voice profiles for versatile audio delivery.

### Technical Features:
* **Granular Audio Control:** Real-time modulation of speed (0.5 to 2.0) and output intensity (0.0 to 1.0).
* **Streamlined UI Architecture:** A responsive, dark-mode frontend built for visual clarity and operational efficiency.
* **Localized Server Deployment:** Optimized for secure, local-host execution on port 5000.
